# Digital-Work-Space
A digital work space for a university

to use this project, you'll need to create a React Application for each of the twol applications.
then you will replace the src folder in your newly created application with the src file in this repository [goes for both applications]

and then you will use uvicorn to run the backends [terminal commands], and you will use npm start to run the react applications.
you can also change ports if needed [for both the front end and the back end].
